The timing is not the same when it's latching a zero it takes three ticks and when it's latching a 1 it takes two ticks. This is increased by one in the matched timing version for both Q and Qn. In the non timing matched version Qn will switch either one before or one after Q, But in the matched one I have slightly changed the circuit so that they switch at the same time although there is still a difference between switching on and switching off.
